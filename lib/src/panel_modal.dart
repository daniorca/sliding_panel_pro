/// Shows a modal [SlidingPanel].
///
/// Works similar to [showModalBottomSheet].
/// The normal SlidingPanel is just a widget. But by calling this,
/// the panel acts as a whole new route.
///
/// You can customize the panel as usual. (See below for changes).
///
/// Returns a `Future` that resolves to the value (if any) that was
/// passed to [Navigator.pop] when the SlidingPanel was closed.
///
///
///
/// Below things affect the panel behavior, rest is not affected:
///
/// [SlidingPanel.parallaxSlideAmount] will not work.
/// [SlidingPanel.animatedAppearing] is ignored, as the modal panel always
/// animtes while it appears.
/// [PanelContent.bodyContent] is ignored.
///
/// When initialized (this function is called), a new route will be pushed.
/// After pushing the route, the initial state (animation) of the panel is
/// decided by [SlidingPanel.initialState] as below:
///
/// (1) For two-state panels, [InitialPanelState.collapsed] is ALWAYS considered
/// to be [InitialPanelState.expanded].
///
/// (2) If [InitialPanelState.closed] is given, and IF [PanelSize.closedHeight]
/// is 0.0, it will be considered as [InitialPanelState.collapsed] (and
/// [InitialPanelState.expanded] for two-state).
///
/// (3) If [InitialPanelState.dismissed] is given, it will be considered as
/// [InitialPanelState.closed]. (Will also change the decision based on above
/// given conditions).
///
///
/// After this, panel will listen for changes in its position. Route's popping
/// is decided by [BackPressBehavior] and [PanelPoppingBehavior].
///
///
/// A panel is also considered to pop the route, when:
///
/// (1) When [PanelSize.closedHeight] is 0.0 and [PanelState.closed] happens,
/// either by dragging or by [PanelController], the route gets popped.
///
/// (2) When [PanelSize.closedHeight] is more than 0.0 (e.g.,
/// [PanelAutoSizing.headerSizeIsClosed] used), [PanelState.closed] won't pop
/// the route. At that time, currentHeight=0.0 ([PanelState.dismissed])
/// pops the route.
